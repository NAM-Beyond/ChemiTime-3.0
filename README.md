# ChemiTime-3.0

A simple web application to display a timeline of medications taken by patients

It's based on 2 different main inputs by the user :

  Time of beginning and end of a treatment
  
  Treatment considered which include as sub-inputs : a) Name of treatment + a list of the already existing treatment b) Dose c) Selecting a color to ease readability
  
  Submit button
  
  Few lines of "How to use this application"

Aimed to use drag-and-drop function for this version.

Considering that the timeline could have a quite wide range (several years of treatment), code should be as simple as possible and an option to select range of time to display should be available.

Also a function to store the tiemline created or to upload an existing one to update it should be created.
