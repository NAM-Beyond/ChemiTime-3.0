# ChemiTime-3.0

A simple web application to display a timeline of medications taken by patients

It's based on 3 different main inputs by the user :
  1) Top-Left : Name of treatment (INN)
  2) Top-Right : Dose taken
  3) Bottom-Right : Time display with alignement to dose boxes
  
Aimed to use CSS "grid" and "flex" in order to have easy aligned elements and simplify the code that manage treatment input

Few lines of "How to use this application"

Considering that the timeline could have a quite wide range (several years of treatment), code should be as simple as possible and an option to select range of time to display should be available.

A function to store the tiemline created or to upload an existing one to update it should be created.

Also, a side branch should be created to test the use of drag & drop API
